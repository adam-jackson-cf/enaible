# Purpose

Evaluate system architecture quality by combining automated structural analyzers with contextual review of layering, coupling, and scalability trade-offs.

## Variables

### Required

- @TARGET_PATH = $1 — path to analyze; defaults to repo root

### Optional (derived from $ARGUMENTS)

- @AUTO = --auto — skip STOP confirmations (auto-approve checkpoints)
- @MIN_SEVERITY = --min-severity — defaults to "high"; accepts critical|high|medium|low
- @EXCLUDE = --exclude [repeatable] — additional glob patterns to exclude
- @VERBOSE = --verbose — emit extended analyzer metadata and reasoning notes

### Derived (internal)

- @ARTIFACT_ROOT = <derived> — timestamped artifacts directory for architecture evidence

## Instructions

- ALWAYS run Enaible analyzers; do not call analyzer modules directly.
- Persist every analyzer output plus derived notes under @ARTIFACT_ROOT for auditability.
- Tie structural findings to concrete files, modules, or layers before recommending action.
- Highlight architectural decisions (patterns, contracts, boundaries) and verify they align with documented system intents.
- When @VERBOSE is provided, include extended metadata (dependency lists, hop counts, pattern scores) inside the final report.
- Respect STOP confirmations unless @AUTO is provided; when auto is active, treat checkpoints as approved without altering other behavior.

## Workflow

1. **Establish artifacts directory**
   - Set `ARTIFACT_ROOT=".enaible/artifacts/analyze-architecture/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"` and create it.
2. **Run automated analyzers**

   - Execute each Enaible command, storing JSON output beneath @ARTIFACT_ROOT:

     ```bash
     uv run --project tools/enaible enaible analyzers run architecture:patterns \
       --target "@TARGET_PATH" \
       --out "@ARTIFACT_ROOT/architecture-patterns.json"

     uv run --project tools/enaible enaible analyzers run architecture:dependency \
       --target "@TARGET_PATH" \
       --out "@ARTIFACT_ROOT/architecture-dependency.json"

     uv run --project tools/enaible enaible analyzers run architecture:coupling \
       --target "@TARGET_PATH" \
       --out "@ARTIFACT_ROOT/architecture-coupling.json"

     uv run --project tools/enaible enaible analyzers run architecture:scalability \
       --target "@TARGET_PATH" \
       --out "@ARTIFACT_ROOT/architecture-scalability.json"
     ```

   - Add `--min-severity "@MIN_SEVERITY"`, `--exclude "<glob>"`, or `--summary` as needed to control output size; rerun without `--summary` before final delivery.
   - Document any exclusions in the final report.

3. **Synthesize architecture baseline**
   - Identify the primary domains, layers, shared libraries, and external interfaces referenced by architecture:patterns.
   - Note whether observed patterns (CQRS, hexagonal, micro-frontends) align with project standards.
4. **Dependency & coupling assessment**
   - Highlight modules with excessive in-degree/out-degree, circular dependencies, or boundary violations surfaced by architecture:dependency and architecture:coupling.
   - Map findings to concrete files/services and describe user-visible risk (regression blast radius, deployment friction, scalability constraints).
5. **Scalability evaluation**
   - Review architecture:scalability signals for bottlenecks (synchronous fan-out, global locks, shared state) and capture recommended guardrails or capacity tests.
6. **Deliver report**
   - Summarize architecture health, list hotspots, and propose remediation with impact/effort guidance.
   - Reference analyzer artifacts directly so stakeholders can inspect raw findings.
