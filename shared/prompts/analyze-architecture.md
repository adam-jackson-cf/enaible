# Purpose

Evaluate system architecture quality by combining automated structural analyzers with contextual review of layering, coupling, and scalability trade-offs.

## Variables

### Required

- @TARGET_PATH = $1 — path to analyze; defaults to repo root

### Optional (derived from $ARGUMENTS)

- @AUTO = --auto — skip STOP confirmations (auto-approve checkpoints)
- @MIN_SEVERITY = --min-severity — defaults to "high"; accepts critical|high|medium|low
- @EXCLUDE = --exclude [repeatable] — additional glob patterns to exclude
- @VERBOSE = --verbose — emit extended analyzer metadata and reasoning notes

### Derived (internal)

- @ARTIFACT_ROOT = <derived> — timestamped artifacts directory for architecture evidence

## Instructions

- ALWAYS run Enaible analyzers; do not call analyzer modules directly.
- Persist every analyzer output plus derived notes under @ARTIFACT_ROOT for auditability.
- Always read artifacts via absolute paths derived from `@ARTIFACT_ROOT` (avoid relative `.enaible/...` reads).
- Respect `@MIN_SEVERITY` for reporting; do not rerun at lower severity. If lower-severity findings exist, direct users to the JSON artifacts instead of re-running.
- Run analyzers concurrently where feasible to reduce total execution time; ensure each writes to its own artifact file.
- Tie structural findings to concrete files, modules, or layers before recommending action.
- Highlight architectural decisions (patterns, contracts, boundaries) and verify they align with documented system intents.
- When @VERBOSE is provided, include extended metadata (dependency lists, hop counts, pattern scores) inside the final report.
- Respect STOP confirmations unless @AUTO is provided; when auto is active, treat checkpoints as approved without altering other behavior.
- Run reconnaissance before analyzers to detect project context and auto-apply smart exclusions.
- After synthesis, explicitly identify gaps in deterministic tool coverage and backfill where possible.

## Workflow

1. **Establish artifacts directory**
   - Resolve the repo root and target path, then create the artifacts directory:

     ```bash
     PROJECT_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
     TARGET_PATH="@TARGET_PATH"
     if [ -z "$TARGET_PATH" ] || [ "$TARGET_PATH" = "." ]; then
       TARGET_PATH="$PROJECT_ROOT"
     elif [ "${TARGET_PATH#/}" = "$TARGET_PATH" ]; then
       TARGET_PATH="$PROJECT_ROOT/$TARGET_PATH"
     fi
     ARTIFACT_ROOT="$PROJECT_ROOT/.enaible/artifacts/analyze-architecture/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
     mkdir -p "$ARTIFACT_ROOT"
     ```

2. **Reconnaissance**
   - Glob for project markers: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`
   - Detect layout: monorepo vs single-project, primary language(s), framework conventions
   - Record detected languages and note which analyzers will run or be skipped (with reason)
   - Auto-apply exclusions for generated/vendor directories: `dist/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.next/`, `vendor/`, `.venv/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.gradle/`, `target/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `coverage/`, `.turbo/`, `.svelte-kit/`, `.cache/`, `.enaible/artifacts/`
   - Merge with any user-provided @EXCLUDE patterns
   - Note architectural patterns to look for based on detected stack (e.g., Rails conventions, Spring layers, React component hierarchy)
   - Log applied exclusions for final report
3. **Run automated analyzers**
   - Execute each Enaible command, storing JSON output beneath @ARTIFACT_ROOT:

     ```bash
     ENAIBLE_REPO_ROOT="$PROJECT_ROOT" uv run --directory tools/enaible enaible analyzers run architecture:patterns \
       --target "$TARGET_PATH" \
       --min-severity "@MIN_SEVERITY" \
       --out "$ARTIFACT_ROOT/architecture-patterns.json" \
       @EXCLUDE

     ENAIBLE_REPO_ROOT="$PROJECT_ROOT" uv run --directory tools/enaible enaible analyzers run architecture:dependency \
       --target "$TARGET_PATH" \
       --min-severity "@MIN_SEVERITY" \
       --out "$ARTIFACT_ROOT/architecture-dependency.json" \
       @EXCLUDE

     ENAIBLE_REPO_ROOT="$PROJECT_ROOT" uv run --directory tools/enaible enaible analyzers run architecture:coupling \
       --target "$TARGET_PATH" \
       --min-severity "@MIN_SEVERITY" \
       --out "$ARTIFACT_ROOT/architecture-coupling.json" \
       @EXCLUDE

     ENAIBLE_REPO_ROOT="$PROJECT_ROOT" uv run --directory tools/enaible enaible analyzers run architecture:scalability \
       --target "$TARGET_PATH" \
       --min-severity "@MIN_SEVERITY" \
       --out "$ARTIFACT_ROOT/architecture-scalability.json" \
       @EXCLUDE
     ```

   - Add `--summary` as needed to control output size; keep full artifacts as audit evidence.
   - Document any exclusions in the final report.

4. **Synthesize architecture baseline**
   - Identify the primary domains, layers, shared libraries, and external interfaces referenced by architecture:patterns.
   - Note whether observed patterns (CQRS, hexagonal, micro-frontends) align with project standards.
   - Capture evidence for domain boundaries (top 3 files/dirs that define each boundary).
5. **Dependency & coupling assessment**
   - Highlight modules with excessive in-degree/out-degree, circular dependencies, or boundary violations surfaced by architecture:dependency and architecture:coupling.
   - Rank top hotspots by severity or fan-in/out to keep the report actionable.
   - Map findings to concrete files/services and describe user-visible risk (regression blast radius, deployment friction, scalability constraints).
6. **Scalability evaluation**
   - Review architecture:scalability signals for bottlenecks (synchronous fan-out, global locks, shared state) and capture recommended guardrails or capacity tests.
7. **Identify coverage gaps**
   - List what the analyzers checked (structural patterns, dependency graphs, coupling metrics, scalability signals) vs. what they cannot check
   - For each gap category:
     - Business domain alignment: inspect naming conventions and module boundaries for semantic fit
     - Team ownership boundaries: check for CODEOWNERS or ownership markers
     - Cross-cutting concerns: review logging, auth, and error-handling patterns for consistency
   - If inspectable via code reading: perform targeted review, cite evidence
   - If requires runtime/external info: flag as "requires manual verification"
   - Assign confidence: High (tool + LLM agreement), Medium (LLM inference only), Low (couldn't verify)
8. **Deliver report**
   - Summarize architecture health, list hotspots, and propose remediation with impact/effort guidance.
   - Reference analyzer artifacts directly so stakeholders can inspect raw findings.
