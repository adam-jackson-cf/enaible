## Executive Summary Guidelines

### Structure

1. **Context** (1-2 sentences): Why this research was conducted
2. **Key Findings** (3-5 bullets): Most important discoveries
3. **Implications** (2-3 sentences): What this means for decisions
4. **Recommendations** (2-3 bullets): Priority actions

### Length

- Executive brief: 150-250 words
- Detailed report: 300-500 words

## Findings Organization

### By Theme (Preferred)

Organize findings by topic or theme rather than by research domain or methodology. This creates a more coherent narrative.

**Good**: "Competitive Positioning", "User Adoption Barriers", "Technical Feasibility"

**Avoid**: "Market Research Findings", "Technical Research Findings", "User Research Findings"

### Evidence Integration

For each major finding:

- State the finding clearly
- Provide supporting evidence with citations
- Note confidence level if not HIGH
- Include relevant counter-evidence or limitations

## Recommendations Format

### Structure

Each recommendation should include:

1. **Action**: What to do (specific and actionable)
2. **Rationale**: Why this matters (link to findings)
3. **Evidence**: Citations supporting this recommendation
4. **Priority**: High/Medium/Low with justification

### Example

```markdown
**Recommendation**: Focus initial market entry on mid-market SaaS companies

**Rationale**: This segment shows highest growth (23% YoY) with underserved
needs that align with our differentiators [1][2].

**Evidence**: Market analysis shows mid-market represents $4.2B opportunity
[3], and user research indicates strong demand for our key features [4][5].

**Priority**: HIGH - Aligns competitive advantages with market opportunity
```
