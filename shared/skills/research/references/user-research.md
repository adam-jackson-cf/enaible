# Purpose

Understand user behaviors, needs, and contexts to inform user-centered product decisions.

## Persona Development Framework

### Persona Components

For each persona, document:

- **Demographics**: Age range, role/title, experience level, technical proficiency
- **Context**: Work environment, tools used, team structure, constraints
- **Goals**: Primary objectives, success metrics, aspirations
- **Pain Points**: Current frustrations, inefficiencies, unmet needs
- **Behaviors**: Workflows, preferences, decision patterns, information sources
- **Quote**: Representative statement capturing their perspective

### Persona Creation Process

1. Research user demographics and contexts through secondary sources
2. Identify behavioral patterns and preference clusters
3. Document goals, frustrations, and current workflows
4. Create empathy-building narratives
5. Validate against available data points

### Persona Template

```markdown

## User Journey Mapping

### Journey Stages

1. **Awareness**: How users discover the problem/solution
2. **Consideration**: How they evaluate options
3. **Decision**: What triggers selection
4. **Onboarding**: Initial experience and setup
5. **Usage**: Day-to-day interaction patterns
6. **Advocacy/Churn**: What drives loyalty or abandonment

### Journey Map Components

| Stage   | Actions       | Thoughts              | Emotions      | Opportunities    |
| ------- | ------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| [Stage] | What users do | What they're thinking | How they feel | Where to improve |

### Touchpoint Analysis

For each touchpoint:

- Channel (web, mobile, in-person, etc.)
- User goal at this moment
- Current experience quality
- Pain points and friction
- Improvement opportunities

## Secondary Research Sources

### User Feedback Channels

- **App store reviews**: Feature requests, complaints, praise patterns
- **Support tickets**: Common issues, confusion points, feature gaps
- **Social media**: Sentiment, use cases, competitor mentions
- **Forums/Reddit**: In-depth discussions, workarounds, feature requests
- **Review sites**: G2, Capterra, TrustRadius for B2B

### Behavioral Data Sources

- **Industry reports**: User behavior studies, market research
- **Academic research**: UX studies, behavioral psychology
- **Competitor analysis**: How competitors address similar users
- **Job postings**: Skills and tools associated with target roles

## Problem Analysis Framework

### Problem Statement Template

```markdown
**Problem**: [Clear description of the issue]
**User Impact**: [How it affects their success/goals]
**Frequency**: [How often this occurs]
**Severity**: [Impact when it does occur]
**Root Causes**: [Underlying factors]
**Evidence**: [Supporting data and examples]
```

### Root Cause Analysis

- Move beyond surface symptoms
- Ask "why" multiple times to find underlying causes
- Map problems to user goals and workflows
- Identify environmental constraints
- Consider both individual and systemic factors

## Output Structure

### User Research Summary

1. **Research Objectives**: What questions we sought to answer
2. **Methodology**: Sources consulted, analysis approach
3. **Personas**: 2-4 detailed personas representing key segments
4. **Key Insights**: Cross-cutting findings and patterns
5. **Journey Maps**: Visual representation of user experiences
6. **Recommendations**: Product implications and opportunities
