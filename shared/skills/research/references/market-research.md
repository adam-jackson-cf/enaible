# Purpose

Conduct market research, competitive analysis, and strategic business intelligence using structured methodologies.

## Competitive Intelligence Framework

### Competitor Identification

1. **Direct competitors**: Same product/service, same market
2. **Indirect competitors**: Different product, same customer problem
3. **Emerging competitors**: New entrants, adjacent market players
4. **Substitute providers**: Alternative solutions to the same need

### Competitive Analysis Components

For each competitor, gather:

- Company overview and positioning
- Product/service offerings and pricing
- Target market and customer segments
- Strengths and competitive advantages
- Weaknesses and vulnerabilities
- Recent strategic moves and initiatives

## Market Sizing Approaches

### Top-Down (TAM/SAM/SOM)

- **TAM** (Total Addressable Market): Total market demand for product category
- **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market): Portion of TAM targeted by your offering
- **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market): Realistic capture given competition

### Bottom-Up Validation

- Calculate from unit economics and customer counts
- Cross-reference with top-down estimates
- Note discrepancies and likely explanations
