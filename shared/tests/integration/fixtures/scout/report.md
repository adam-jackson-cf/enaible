Status readiness hinges on three anchored wins: 1) shared prompt bodies already live under `shared/prompts/` with system wrappers staged, 2) exec plans spell out the migration ladder from CLI scaffold through CI guardrails, and 3) the upcoming Typer-based `tools/enaible/` wrapper is defined to centralize analyzer invocation and JSON normalization once built.
Immediate gaps drive the follow-up queue: 1) scaffold `tools/enaible/` so prompts stop shelling out with brittle PYTHONPATH juggling, 2) deliver template adapters and render helpers to unblock automatic regeneration of system wrappers, and 3) wire `enaible prompts render/diff` into CI so guardrails catch drift before release.
