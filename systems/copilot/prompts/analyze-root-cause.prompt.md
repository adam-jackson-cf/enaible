# Purpose

Discover the fundamental cause of an incident or defect through evidence-based investigation across code changes, execution traces, and environment factors.

## Variables

### Required

- @ISSUE_DESCRIPTION = ${input:issue-description} — description of the defect or incident

### Optional (derived from $ARGUMENTS)

- @AUTO = ${input:auto} — skip STOP confirmations (auto-approve checkpoints)
- @EXCLUDE = ${input:exclude} [repeatable] — additional glob patterns to exclude (e.g., test_codebase/\*\*)
- @MIN_SEVERITY = ${input:min-severity} — defaults to "high"; accepts critical|high|medium|low
- @TARGET_PATH = ${input:target-path} — path to analyze; defaults to repo root
- @VERBOSE = ${input:verbose} — enable verbose diagnostics capture

### Derived (internal)

- @ARTIFACT_ROOT — timestamped artifacts path used for evidence capture


## Instructions

- ALWAYS capture the issue description before running analyzers; stop if details are insufficient.
- Validate @TARGET_PATH (default `.`) exists and is readable before executing analyzers.
- Use Enaible analyzers exclusively—do not probe for scripts or import modules manually.
- Persist artifacts under `.enaible/artifacts/analyze-root-cause/` for traceability.
- Correlate findings across recent changes, error patterns, and traces; clearly separate hypotheses from confirmed evidence.
- When @VERBOSE is provided, gather extended diagnostics (logs, stack traces) and document how they influence the conclusion.
- Respect STOP confirmations unless @AUTO is provided; when auto is active, treat checkpoints as approved without altering other behavior.
- Run reconnaissance before analyzers to detect project context and auto-apply smart exclusions.
- After synthesis, explicitly identify gaps in deterministic tool coverage and backfill where possible.

## Workflow

1. **Validate inputs**
   - Confirm @ISSUE_DESCRIPTION is present. If missing, request more information or explicit approval to proceed with assumptions.
   - Resolve @TARGET_PATH (default `.`) and ensure it is readable.
   - Note whether @VERBOSE is enabled.
2. **Establish artifacts directory**
   - Set `@ARTIFACT_ROOT=".enaible/artifacts/analyze-root-cause/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"` and create it.
3. **Reconnaissance**
   - Glob for project markers: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`
   - Detect layout: monorepo vs single-project, primary language(s), deployment topology indicators
   - Auto-apply exclusions for generated/vendor directories: `dist/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.next/`, `vendor/`
   - Merge with any user-provided @EXCLUDE patterns
   - Note root-cause-relevant context: logging infrastructure, error tracking services, deployment configs
   - Log applied exclusions for final report
4. **Run automated analyzers**

   - Execute each Enaible command, storing the JSON output:

     ```bash
     enaible analyzers run root_cause:trace_execution \
       --target "@TARGET_PATH" \
       --out "@ARTIFACT_ROOT/root-cause-trace.json"

     enaible analyzers run root_cause:recent_changes \
       --target "@TARGET_PATH" \
       --out "@ARTIFACT_ROOT/root-cause-recent-changes.json"

     enaible analyzers run root_cause:error_patterns \
       --target "@TARGET_PATH" \
       --out "@ARTIFACT_ROOT/root-cause-error-patterns.json"
     ```

   - When @VERBOSE is provided, capture additional evidence (stack traces, logs) and note their locations inside `ARTIFACT_ROOT`.
   - Add `--exclude "<glob>"` or adjust `--min-severity` to limit noise while focusing on the suspected components.
   - If any invocation fails, review options with `enaible analyzers run --help` before retrying.

5. **Analyze results**
   - Correlate change timelines with error occurrences.
   - Map stack traces to code locations and execution paths.
   - Identify recurring error signatures and environment triggers.
6. **Perform causal reasoning**
   - Apply techniques such as Five Whys, timeline reconstruction, and hypothesis testing.
   - Distinguish primary root causes from contributing factors or unknowns that require follow-up.
7. **Recommend remediation**
   - Propose fixes, regression tests, and preventive measures.
   - Surface open questions or missing data that must be resolved before rollout.
8. **Identify coverage gaps**
   - List what the analyzers checked (traces, recent changes, error patterns) vs. what they cannot check
   - For each gap category:
     - Environmental differences: compare prod vs dev configs, feature flags, dependency versions
     - Timing/race conditions: review async code and concurrent access patterns for non-deterministic behavior
     - Data-dependent paths: inspect code paths that vary based on input data or state
   - If inspectable via code reading: perform targeted review, cite evidence
   - If requires runtime/external info: flag as "requires manual verification"
   - Assign confidence: High (tool + LLM agreement), Medium (LLM inference only), Low (couldn't verify)
9. **Deliver report**
   - Summarize evidence, findings, and next actions in a structured format.
   - Reference analyzer outputs using the artifact paths recorded earlier.
