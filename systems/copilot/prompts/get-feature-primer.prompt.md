## Purpose

Explore the codebase and produce a feature primer tailored to @USER_PROMPT, covering context, risks, and next actions.

## Variables

### Required

- @USER_PROMPT = ${input:user-prompt} — task brief to guide the analysis

### Optional (derived from $ARGUMENTS)

- @AUTO = ${input:auto} — skip STOP confirmations (auto-approve checkpoints)
- @DAYS = ${input:days} — history window for insights (default 20)
- @EXCLUDE_GLOBS = ${input:exclude} [repeatable] — CSV or repeated flags (e.g., node_modules,dist)
- @OUT = ${input:out} — write the final Markdown to this path (also print to stdout)
- @TARGET_PATH = ${input:target} — root to analyze (default .)

## Instructions

- Operate read-only (apart from writing the report). Do not run builds or install tools.
- Use repository commands (`ls`, `rg`, `git`, `sed`, etc.) to gather facts, then summarize findings in clear prose;
- Avoid dumping raw command syntax unless you are showing an illustrative example.
- Format every section for quick scanning: short paragraphs, bullet lists, and tables. Keep guidance concise and documentation-focused.
- When secrets are encountered, note file and nature only—never print the secret.
- Default to the repository root when @TARGET_PATH is not supplied; respect @EXCLUDE_GLOBS for all searches.
- Respect STOP confirmations unless @AUTO is provided; when auto is active, treat checkpoints as approved without altering other behavior.

## Workflow

1. **Scope & Setup**

   - Resolve @TARGET_PATH, record the working directory, and respect @EXCLUDE_GLOBS by deriving EXCLUDE_ARG from `.gitignore` (and `.git/info/exclude` when present).
   - Confirm the command operates read-only except for writing the final report to @OUT.

2. **Deep Analysis (LLM + file-driven)**

   - Dispatch parallel task agents to review how the project supports @USER_PROMPT across:
     - Architecture & Orchestration
     - Backend Patterns & Practices
     - Frontend Patterns & Practices
     - Data & State
     - Performance & Security
     - Observability
     - Quality gates and Testing Practices
     - Entry points, services, CLIs, routing surfaces, configurations, manifests, and framework signals
   - Capture supporting facts with repository commands (`ls`, `rg`, `git`, `sed`, etc.) and convert them into concise documentation-ready notes.

3. **Git History & Pattern Recognition (last @DAYS days)**

   - Run history commands to surface recent themes, key contributors, and churn hotspots:

     ```bash
     git status
     git log --since="${DAYS:-20} days ago"
     git shortlog -sn --since="${DAYS:-20} days ago"
     ```

   - Summarize new features, notable fixes, regressions, and recurring smells that impact the upcoming work.

4. **Synthesis**
   - Populate the provided report template with structured bullets, tables, and short paragraphs tailored to @USER_PROMPT.
   - Keep guidance action-oriented, avoid duplicating file paths, and write the final Markdown to @OUT while echoing the same content to stdout (no prefaces, fences, or tool logs).
