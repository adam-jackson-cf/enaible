## Purpose

Generate a comprehensive project primer covering purpose, architecture, tech stack, commands, and testing practices.

## Variables

### Optional (derived from $ARGUMENTS)

- @AUTO = ${input:auto} — skip STOP confirmations (auto-approve checkpoints)
- @TARGET_PATH = ${input:target-path} — path to analyze; defaults to the project

## Instructions

- Read all relevant docs (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README variants) before synthesizing conclusions.
- Capture findings for purpose, features, tech stack, architecture, commands, and testing.
- Summaries must be concise yet comprehensive, referencing concrete files and directories.
- Include recent git history insights to surface active development themes.
- Respect STOP confirmations unless @AUTO is provided; when auto is active, treat checkpoints as approved without altering other behavior.

## Workflow

1. **Deep Analysis** (LLM + file-driven)

Analyse the following aspects of the target codebase:

- Architecture & Orchestration
- Backend Patterns & Practices
- Frontend Patterns & Practices
- Data & State
- Performance & Security
- Observability
- Quality gates and Testing Practices
- Identify entry points, apps/services, CLIs, servers, and routing surfaces.
- Locate key configurations and framework signals
- Documentation, Global rules files and configs

2. **Git history review**

   - Run `git status`, `git log --since="30 days ago"`, and `git shortlog -sn --since="30 days ago"` (adjust window when @TARGET_PATH differs).
   - Capture recent themes, active contributors, and churn hotspots for inclusion in the primer.

3. **Generate Project Primer**
   - Compile findings into standardized markdown format.
   - Present comprehensive project overview.
