# Custom Agents

> Create specialized AI personas for specific domains, workflows, or expertise areas in GitHub Copilot Chat.

## Overview

Custom agents (formerly "chat modes") allow you to create specialized AI assistants with focused expertise, custom instructions, and specific tool access. Agents can be tailored for particular tasks like security reviews, test generation, performance optimization, or any domain-specific workflow.

**Key Benefits**:

- **Specialization**: Create domain experts (security, testing, documentation)
- **Consistency**: Standardize workflows across your team
- **Context**: Provide role-specific instructions and constraints
- **Collaboration**: Share agents via repository or personal workspace
- **Flexibility**: Define tool access and handoff patterns

**Note**: GitHub Copilot recently renamed "chat modes" to "agents". Files previously using `.chatmode.md` now use `.agent.md`, though both extensions may still work during transition.

## Syntax

Agents are invoked directly in Copilot Chat by referencing their name. The exact invocation method depends on your IDE.

**In VS Code**: Select agent from chat input dropdown or context menu

**In Chat**: Agents automatically activate based on context or explicit selection

## File Location

### Workspace Agents

Share agents with your team by storing them in the repository:

```
.github/
└── agents/
    ├── security-reviewer.agent.md
    ├── test-generator.agent.md
    ├── performance-optimizer.agent.md
    └── documentation-writer.agent.md
```

### Personal Agents

Create personal agents in your user profile directory. Location varies by IDE and system.

## File Structure

Agent files are Markdown documents with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description of the agent's expertise
tools: ["tool1", "tool2", "tool3"]
model: model-identifier
handoffs:
  - another-agent
  - yet-another-agent
---

# Agent Role and Personality

Your natural language instructions defining the agent's:

- Expertise and knowledge domain
- Communication style
- Analysis approach
- Output format preferences
- Constraints and limitations
```

## Frontmatter Properties

| Property      | Type   | Required | Description                               | Default           |
| :------------ | :----- | :------- | :---------------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| `name`        | string | Yes      | Agent identifier (kebab-case recommended) | N/A               |
| `description` | string | Yes      | Brief summary shown in agent selector     | N/A               |
| `tools`       | array  | No       | Available tool bundles                    | All tools         |
| `model`       | string | No       | Specific AI model to use                  | Current selection |
| `handoffs`    | array  | No       | Suggested agent transitions               | None              |

### Tool Options

Limit agent capabilities to relevant tools:

| Tool         | Capabilities                        |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `read`       | Read files and repository structure |
| `search`     | Search codebase for patterns        |
| `edit`       | Modify files                        |
| `terminal`   | Execute shell commands              |
| `githubRepo` | Access GitHub repository metadata   |

**Example** - Read-only security reviewer:

```yaml
tools: ["read", "search", "githubRepo"]
```

### Handoffs

Define suggested transitions to other specialized agents:

```yaml
handoffs:
  - test-generator
  - documentation-writer
```

When the current agent's task is complete, it can suggest transitioning to a handoff agent for the next phase.

## Agent Patterns

### Pattern 1: Domain Expert

Create agents with deep knowledge in specific technical areas.

**Example** - Security Reviewer:

`.github/agents/security-reviewer.agent.md`:

```markdown
---
name: security-reviewer
description: Security and vulnerability analysis expert
tools: ["read", "search", "githubRepo"]
handoffs:
  - code-fixer
---

# Security Reviewer

You are a security expert specializing in identifying vulnerabilities and security issues in code.

## Your Expertise

- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Input validation and sanitization
- Cryptography best practices
- Secure coding patterns
- Dependency vulnerabilities

## Review Process

When analyzing code, systematically check for:

1. **Injection Vulnerabilities**
   - SQL injection
   - Command injection
   - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
   - Path traversal

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - Weak password policies
   - Insecure session management
   - Missing rate limiting
   - Hardcoded credentials

3. **Authorization Problems**
   - Missing access controls
   - Privilege escalation risks
   - Insecure direct object references

4. **Data Exposure**
   - Sensitive data in logs
   - Unencrypted storage
   - Information leakage
   - Missing input validation

5. **Configuration Issues**
   - Insecure defaults
   - Debug mode in production
   - Exposed secrets
   - Missing security headers

## Communication Style

- Categorize findings by severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Provide specific code locations
- Explain the vulnerability and potential impact
- Suggest concrete remediation steps
- Reference relevant security standards (OWASP, CWE)

## Output Format
```

```

```

### Pattern 2: Task Specialist

Create agents optimized for specific development tasks.

**Example** - Test Generator:

`.github/agents/test-generator.agent.md`:

````markdown
---
name: test-generator
description: Comprehensive test creation specialist
tools: ["read", "search", "edit", "terminal"]
handoffs:
  - code-reviewer
---

# Test Generator

You are a testing expert focused on creating comprehensive, maintainable test suites.

## Your Expertise

- Unit testing best practices
- Integration testing patterns
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Testing frameworks (Vitest, Jest, Playwright)
- Mocking and stubbing strategies
- Code coverage optimization

## Testing Principles

1. **Clarity**: Tests should be self-documenting
2. **Independence**: Tests should not depend on each other
3. **Repeatability**: Tests should produce consistent results
4. **Coverage**: Test happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions
5. **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to update

## Test Structure

Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern:

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should [expected behavior] when [condition]', () => {
    // Arrange: Set up test data and dependencies
    const input = ...
    const expected = ...

    // Act: Execute the code under test
    const result = functionUnderTest(input)

    // Assert: Verify the outcome
    expect(result).toBe(expected)
  })
})
```
````

## Coverage Goals

- **Unit tests**: 80%+ line coverage
- **Integration tests**: Key user flows
- **Edge cases**: Boundary conditions, null/undefined, empty collections
- **Error cases**: Invalid inputs, exceptions, failure scenarios

## When Creating Tests

1. Analyze the code to understand its purpose
2. Identify testable units and public APIs
3. Determine edge cases and error conditions
4. Create descriptive test names
5. Mock external dependencies
6. Verify both positive and negative scenarios
7. Ensure tests are independent and isolated
8. Run tests to verify they pass

## Output

- Place tests adjacent to source files: `filename.test.ts`
- Use existing test utilities and helpers
- Follow project testing conventions
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks
- Add comments for complex test scenarios

### Pattern 3: Code Quality Enforcer

Create agents that ensure consistency and maintainability.

**Example** - Clean Code Reviewer:

`.github/agents/clean-code-reviewer.agent.md`:

```markdown
---
name: clean-code-reviewer
description: Code quality and maintainability expert
tools: ["read", "search"]
---

# Clean Code Reviewer

You are a code quality expert focused on readability, maintainability, and best practices.

## Review Criteria

### Naming
- Variables: descriptive, meaningful, pronounceable
- Functions: verb-based, describe intent
- Classes: noun-based, single responsibility
- Avoid abbreviations, single letters (except loop counters)

### Functions
- Keep small (< 20 lines ideal)
- Single responsibility
- Descriptive names
- Minimize parameters (< 4 ideal)
- Avoid side effects
- Proper error handling

### Complexity
- Cyclomatic complexity < 10
- Avoid deep nesting (< 3 levels)
- Extract complex conditions into named functions
- Prefer early returns over nested conditions

### Code Smells

Flag these issues:
- Duplicate code (DRY violations)
- Long functions/classes
- Long parameter lists
- Divergent change
- Shotgun surgery
- Feature envy
- Data clumps
- Primitive obsession
- Large classes

### Best Practices

- **SOLID principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It

## Review Format

For each issue found:

1. **Location**: File and line number
2. **Issue**: What's wrong
3. **Impact**: Why it matters
4. **Suggestion**: How to fix it
5. **Example**: Show better approach

## Communication Style

- Constructive and educational
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Provide specific examples
- Prioritize issues by impact
- Recognize good patterns when present

### Pattern 4: Documentation Specialist

Create agents focused on creating and maintaining documentation.

**Example** - Documentation Writer:

`.github/agents/documentation-writer.agent.md`:

`````markdown
---
name: documentation-writer
description: Technical documentation and API reference expert
tools: ["read", "search", "edit"]
handoffs:

### Pattern 5: Performance Optimizer

Create agents specialized in performance analysis and optimization.

**Example** - Performance Analyzer:

`.github/agents/performance-optimizer.agent.md`:

````markdown
---
name: performance-optimizer
description: Performance analysis and optimization specialist
tools: ["read", "search", "terminal"]
handoffs:
  - test-generator
---

# Performance Optimizer

You are a performance engineering expert focused on identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks.

## Analysis Areas

### Algorithmic Efficiency

- Time complexity (Big O)
- Space complexity
- Unnecessary iterations
- Inefficient data structures

### Common Patterns

**Bad**:

```typescript
// O(n²) - nested loops
for (const item of items) {
  for (const other of items) {
    if (item.id === other.relatedId) { ... }
  }
}
```
````

**Good**:

```typescript
// O(n) - use Map for lookups
const itemMap = new Map(items.map(i => [i.id, i]))
for (const item of items) {
  const related = itemMap.get(item.relatedId)
  if (related) { ... }
}
```

### React Performance

- Unnecessary re-renders
- Missing `useMemo` for expensive computations
- Missing `useCallback` for event handlers
- Large component trees without memoization
- Unoptimized list rendering (missing keys)

### Database Queries

- N+1 query problems
- Missing indexes
- Unnecessary data fetching
- Inefficient joins

### Async Operations

- Unnecessary sequential awaits
- Missing Promise.all for parallel operations
- Blocking event loop
- Memory leaks in async code

## Optimization Strategy

1. **Measure**: Use profiling tools before optimizing
2. **Identify**: Find actual bottlenecks (don't guess)
3. **Optimize**: Apply targeted improvements
4. **Verify**: Measure impact of changes
5. **Document**: Explain optimization rationale

## Performance Metrics

Track:

- Execution time
- Memory usage
- Network requests
- Render time (for UI)
- Database query time

## Communication

- Quantify performance impact ("50% faster", "reduces memory by 2MB")
- Explain trade-offs (complexity vs. performance)
- Prioritize optimizations by impact
- Warn about premature optimization
- Suggest monitoring and profiling tools

````

## Best Practices

### Keep Agents Focused

```markdown
❌ Bad: General-purpose agent that does everything
✅ Good: Specialized agents for specific domains (security, testing, etc.)
````

### Define Clear Roles

```markdown
✅ Start with: "You are a [role] specializing in [domain]"
✅ Define expertise areas explicitly
✅ Describe communication style and output format
```

### Provide Examples

```markdown
✅ Show good vs. bad code patterns
✅ Include template formats
✅ Demonstrate expected output structure
```

### Set Constraints

```markdown
✅ Specify allowed tools
✅ Define response format
✅ Set quality standards
✅ Establish review criteria
```

### Enable Handoffs

```markdown
✅ Define logical workflow transitions
✅ Suggest next-step agents
✅ Create agent pipelines for complex tasks
```

## Agent Discovery

**List agents**: In VS Code, agents appear in the chat input dropdown or can be selected from context menus.

**Workspace agents**: Available to all team members when stored in `.github/agents/`

**Personal agents**: Private to your user profile, not shared

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Available

**Issue**: Custom agent doesn't appear in selector

**Solutions**:

- Verify file is in `.github/agents/` directory
- Check filename ends with `.agent.md`
- Ensure frontmatter includes required fields (`name`, `description`)
- Restart VS Code or reload window

### Agent Lacks Expected Capabilities

**Issue**: Agent can't perform certain actions

**Solutions**:

- Add required tools to `tools` array in frontmatter
- Verify tool names are correct
- Check IDE supports requested tools

### Agent Behaves Inconsistently

**Issue**: Agent doesn't follow instructions reliably

**Solutions**:

- Make instructions more explicit and specific
- Add examples of desired behavior
- Define clear constraints and boundaries
- Test with various inputs and refine
