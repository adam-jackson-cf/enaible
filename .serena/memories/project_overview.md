# AI-Assisted Workflows Project Overview

## Purpose

A comprehensive development automation system that combines Claude Code CLI workflows, Python analysis tools, and an 8-agent orchestration system for intelligent code quality management. The project integrates static analysis, security scanning, performance profiling, and architectural analysis into a unified workflow system.

## Project Structure

- **claude-code/**: Claude Code CLI workflows and configurations (28 slash commands, 19 specialized agents)
- **shared/**: Core Python analysis infrastructure (22 analysis tools across 5 categories)
- **test_codebase/**: Controlled test applications for validation (vulnerable and clean apps)
- **docs/**: Comprehensive project documentation
- **todos/**: Task management and workflow documentation

## Key Features

- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Multi-language analysis (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Java, C/C++, and more)
- Security vulnerability scanning and secrets detection
- Performance profiling and bottleneck detection
- Code quality and complexity analysis
- Architectural pattern detection and dependency analysis
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
